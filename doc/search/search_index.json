See Laravel Installation Guide Installing Auctioneer On Linux based vps Auctioneer utilizes composer to manage its dependencies. So, before using auctioneer, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. Unzip auctioneer project and put it into your server directory (For linux the server directory is /var/www/html ). After this go to your project directory and run composer install to download all the dependencies. Directory Permissions After installing auctioneer, you may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the storage and the bootstrap/cache directories should be writable by your web server or Auctioneer will not run. example (for ubuntu. may vary for other linux distributions): sudo chown -R www-data:www-data bootstrap/cache storage/ Environment Setup The next thing you should do after installing auctioneer is Renaming the .env.example file to .env, you should do that now. APP_NAME= My App # Your own exchange name APP_ENV=local # Change it to production once installation is done APP_KEY= # This will be generated by the command given below APP_DEBUG=true # Must be false in production mode APP_PROTOCOL=http # change to https if you have ssl certificate APP_URL=http://your-website.url # Your Web Url APP_TIMEZONE=UTC # Set it to 'UTC' or any timezone you prefer LOG_CHANNEL=stack DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=3306 DB_DATABASE=homestead DB_USERNAME=homestead DB_PASSWORD=secret BROADCAST_DRIVER=log CACHE_DRIVER=file QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync SESSION_DRIVER=file SESSION_LIFETIME=120 REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1 REDIS_PASSWORD=null REDIS_PORT=6379 MAIL_DRIVER=smtp MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io MAIL_PORT=2525 MAIL_USERNAME=null MAIL_PASSWORD=null MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= PUSHER_APP_ID= PUSHER_APP_KEY= PUSHER_APP_SECRET= PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1 MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY= ${PUSHER_APP_KEY} MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER= ${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER} NOCAPTCHA_SECRET= NOCAPTCHA_SITEKEY= N:B: Set SMTP credentials to make registration work properly . Application Key Set your application key to a random string. Typically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the .env environment file. If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure! Follow the command below to generate the key php artisan key:generate Additional Configuration By default Auctioneer store cache and session in files. If you want to change it rename cache and session driver from .env and clear config cache by running php artisan config:clear otherwise the change will not affect on your application. Install Database To make your mysql database ready you need to run following command. php artisan migrate Install initial Data To push initial data in database, run the following command. php artisan db:seed N:B: The website won't run without initial data. To refresh the initial data in database after changing the seeders, run the following command (do not do it once you go live) php artisan migrate:fresh --seed Install NPM packages Auctioneer's user control is built with React JS. To download all javascript packages run the following command npm install N:B: use sudo if required. Build package After installing npm packages you need to build NPM packages for production or local. Run the following command to build as your requirement - For production npm run prod For local npm run dev N:B: use sudo if required. Supervisor Configuration Installing Supervisor Supervisor is a process monitor for the Linux operating system, and will automatically restart your queue:work process if it fails. To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command: sudo apt-get install supervisor If configuring Supervisor yourself sounds overwhelming, consider using Laravel Forge, which will automatically install and configure Supervisor for your Laravel projects. Configuring Horizon Supervisor configuration files are typically stored in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d directory. Within this directory, you may create any number of configuration files that instruct supervisor how your processes should be monitored. For example, let's create a horizon.conf file that starts and monitors a horizon process: [program:horizon] process_name=%(program_name)s command=php /var/www/html/project_directory/artisan horizon autostart=true autorestart=true user=root redirect_stderr=true stdout_logfile=/var/log/horizon.log Replace \u200bproject_directory \u200bto your project directory name. If your server does not have root user, then change the user as well. Make sure /var/log/horizon.log the file is created and has write permission Starting Supervisor Once the configuration file has been created, you may update the Supervisor configuration and start the processes using the following commands: sudo supervisorctl reread sudo supervisorctl update sudo supervisorctl start horizon You need to run the following command to check if your supervisor is running successfully. sudo supervisorctl status Now you ready to go :)","title":"Installation"},{"location":"Installation.html#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"Installation.html#installation-process","text":"","title":"Installation Process"},{"location":"Installation.html#prerequisites","text":"Linux Server (Preferred Ubuntu 18.04) Minimum 4GB RAM Minimum 40GB Space PHP Version = 7.2+ Database (Preferred MYSQL 5.7+) Apache 2.4/Nginx Server (Preferred Apache 2.4) Process Control System (Preferred Supervisord) PHP Dependency Manager (Preferred Composer) Redis Server For Queue Management NodeJs and NPM for JavaScript package Management.","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"Installation.html#prerequisites-php-extension","text":"OpenSSL PHP Extension PDO PHP Extension Mbstring PHP Extension XML PHP Extension Ctype PHP Extension JSON PHP Extension Curl PHP extension GD PHP extension Intl PHP extension BCMath PHP Extension ZIP PHP extension UNZIP PHP extension BCMath PHP extension","title":"Prerequisites PHP extension"},{"location":"Installation.html#installation_1","text":"Auctioneer is made on Laravel and the installation system is same as Laravel.
